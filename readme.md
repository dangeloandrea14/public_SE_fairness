### Environment

environment.yml includes all the necessary requirements to execute the code in this repository. If you have conda installed, you can execute:

``` conda install -f environment.yml``` 

on your terminal to create an environment called "fairness" with all the requirements included. Don't forget to activate the environment after.

<a name="litrev"></a>
### literature_review.csv

This file contains details on the 49 papers that are part of the Literature Review presented in our work.

<a name="data"></a>
### processed_data

This is the folder that contains the data used by the scripts.
total.csv contains the total dataset on Software Engineers, with the bibliometrics stats obtained from scopus.
ita_researchers contains the same + career trajectory, for the Italian Informatics Community. 
se_edges is the DataFrame version of the graph we employed for Network Analysis on the Worldwide SE community. It is generated by the notebook from_dataset_to_graph.ipynb starting from total and included here for ease of use.


<a name="graph"></a>
### from_dataset_to_graph.ipynb

This notebook includes the necessary code to transform the source dataset into a Networkx-compatible dataset, which is later used to create the graph.

<a name="net_analysis"></a>
### network_analysis/net_analysis.ipynb

This is the code to compute Homophily, Clustering Coefficient and Modularity on the network graphs. We only include the code for the worldwide community, but it is the same for the Italian community.

<a name="net_analysis"></a>
### network_analysis/mean_metrics.ipynb

This script contains the code to evaluate mean statistics on publications and citations for each gender group.

<a name="di"></a>
### Disparate_impact/publications.ipynb

This is the code to compute the metrics for the best performing researchers on the field. The code for plotting the graphs is also included.

<a name="metrics"></a>
### Disparate_impact/metrics.py

Helper class containing the definition of Disparate Impact.
